            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And when your <hi>Armie</hi> had <hi>invaded</hi> us (according to the Covenant, no doubt) did they not deny to pa≈øs anie Votes either again≈øt you, or tho≈øe among our ≈øelvs, that as Traytors did, or ≈øhould adhere unto you?

'Tis true, there were a verie few of their number that prote≈øted again≈øt the <hi>perfidiou≈øne≈øs</hi> &amp; <hi>malice</hi> of the re≈øt; but they were able to effect nothing, and the be≈øt remedie again≈øt like evils for the future, was judged to bee its taking away. Wee mu≈øt hereupon ask you one que≈øtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, Whether had you not once Lords of the Articles among you, who had a previous negative upon all things that were to bee con≈øulted in your Parlament, without who≈øe approbation nothing could bee brought into debate? The≈øe you judged a prejudice to your ju≈øt liberties, and you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved them Did wee trouble our ≈øelvs to ask why you did it?

            <p>The next fault is, they have <hi>driven away manie, and impri≈øoned ≈øom of the Members of Parlament.</hi> Here indeed is the thing that grieve's you; your partie is ca≈øt out, by whom you were wont to act all your fine things among≈øt us; and you have no more hopes to effect any thing in Parlament, as formerly: But let me tell you a My≈øterie; you have no ≈øuch rea≈øon to plead the cau≈ø of ≈øom of them, who were not perfectly your Pro≈øelytes; but were at clo≈øe guard with you; they intended to make u≈øe of your <hi>Faction,</hi> for oppre≈ø≈øion of the faithful), and good Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots under the name of <hi>Independents;</hi> which if they could have effected, they would have cared as much for your Religion, when they had ≈øerv'd their turns on't, as you do your ≈øelvs, when you have made ≈øuch u≈øes of it.

            <p>In <hi>England</hi> here was an <hi>Armie</hi> rai≈øed by <hi>Autoritie</hi> of <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Commi≈ø≈øionated</hi> to <hi>de≈øtroie</hi> all the <hi>forces</hi> of the late <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant:</hi> The≈øe under≈øtood of a ≈øort of men adhering to that Tyrant, and labouring, though without Arms, to re-inthrone him. They prevent it, they di≈ø≈øipate the Con≈øpirators: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt whom, becau≈ø they found them not in Arms, they proceeded not to blood, they took away the corrupt part, and left that which was found to ≈øerv the Common-wealth, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114588:9"/>this is their Crime; and for this they are complained of, and as much noi≈ø made about it, as <hi>David</hi> made for his <hi>Ab≈øolom,</hi> again≈øt who≈øe rebellion, the Generals own execution of him (and without a Councell of War too) had put his Ma≈øter whom he ≈øerved, in ≈øafetie.

            <p>This is the brief of both the Ca≈øes, and now let any but them≈øelvs judg. But √¥ yee Commi≈ø≈øioners of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> why did you not tell the vvho≈øe truth? Were not an ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous confe≈ø≈øion better then a Conviction? O that you could

What trouble's them in the pre≈øent Government? are not the ≈øame Laws ≈øtill in force that were? Is not <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter-Hall</hi> ≈øtill open, and the Courts there both of Equitie and Law ≈øit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their times as formerly? Is not Ju≈øtice in all Ca≈øes, both Civil and Criminal, brought to the peoples doors, as freely as in the be≈øt times part? Are not manie grievances of the former Tyrannie heretofore complained of taken off? and that great one which remain's, <hi>viz.</hi> the nece≈ø≈øarie <hi>Levies</hi> of <hi>Money,</hi> is it not their own fault? might not that al≈øo bee taken off, if the people would ≈øee their true <hi>Intere≈øt,</hi> and keep to it? if they would cordially keep this quarrel'd En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, in beeing <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> to the Power that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect's them, and not bee fool'd by the Scots, and the partizans of their King, into a di≈øobedience, which will certainly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine them, not more by ju≈øt puni≈øhment for it, then by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural productions of it, if they could bee ≈øo unhapple as to bring their endeavors into act.

Is there anie thing in it like

And certainly with ≈øuch violence was this thing carried on, that, had not the good providence of God di≈øcovered to our good Patriots here the foul hypocri≈øie of the Scots Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioners, and their de≈øigns, to the execution whereof they went furiou≈øly on, under the veil of this ≈øtalking-hor≈ø the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it had been impo≈øed with as much Autoritie as the ≈øaid mark of the Bea≈øt, that no man ≈øhould either buy, or ≈øell, or live, who had not taken the Covenant; and 'tis a mercie worth all it co≈øt, that their Inva≈øion delivered us out of that ≈ønare. And yet the≈øe hypocrites complain of offering the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114588:11"/>Engagement; compare them and ≈øee the difference. And once again remember <hi>Thou hypocrite to pull out the beam out of thine own eie,</hi> &amp;c. And for a clo≈øe of this Paragraph, bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuaded to remember daily before the Lord in your praiers that hee would deliver you from the fa≈øcinations of <hi>Interest,</hi> that hee would give you ≈øingle hearts and fill them with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and free you from this gro≈øs hypocri≈øie, and from tho≈øe temptations that are ≈øugge≈øted to you from the pride of your own ≈øpirits, and impotent de≈øires of <hi>Domination,</hi> that hee would di≈øcover to you the extreme ignorance and darkne≈øs you lie under, and that hee would give you hearts to love the truth, and embrace it by what≈øoever means it bee offered to your apprehen≈øion:</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In reference to dangers upon the right hand and upon the left, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides anie dutie alreadie repre≈øented to us; Wee conceiv it incumbent to us, ≈øeriou≈øly to recommend the following particulars to all the Land, e≈øpecially to the≈øe that are in tru≈øt, either in Judicatories or Armies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Fir≈øt to watch and praie that in nothing they bee deceived, or com ≈øhort of the dutie, whereunto the Lord call's them in a time of ≈øo manie temptations and great difficulties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Everie one would labor not onely for the knowledg of the Truth, but to have the power and love thereof engraven on their hearts, that they may from an in ward principle of grace and ≈øpiritual life avoid Error, and all the ≈ønares which lead thereunto, and bee encouraged to contend earne≈øtly for the Faith which God hath been plea≈øed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to his Kirk in this Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Not onely is open Malignancie to bee avoided, but men would watch that enmitie again≈øt the work and people of</hi> GOD, <hi>which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily is the birth of jealou≈øie and di≈øcontent and of familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114588:23"/>with ≈øuch as are di≈ø-affected to, or lukewarm in the cau≈ø of</hi> GOD, <hi>≈øteal not into their hearts, and gain not upon their affections by degrees; Experience almo≈øt of all back-≈øliding times and per≈øons hath proved, that the fellow≈øhip of men of a di≈ø-affected or lukewarm temper, blunt's the edg of tenderne≈øs and zeal, and ≈øteal's away the heart, fir≈øt from hone≈øt in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then from the cau≈ø it ≈øelf: There have bin, &amp; are ≈øtill ≈øom in the Land, who in a cunning way of in≈øinuation foment jealou≈øies, and act di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øions, whil≈øt they ≈øeem to bee friends to the Cau≈ø, and by this means do more harm then others by open violence; The≈øe wee would mark and avoid them, that wee may neither endanger our ≈øelvs, nor give offence unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor prejudice the Cau≈ø of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Wee would take diligent heed, that in nothing wee recede from the ju≈øt and nece≈ø≈øarie de≈øires of this Kirk and Kingdom, propounded to his Maje≈øtie, for ≈øecuring of Religion, and ≈øetling the peace of the Kingdom; But that wee cleav clo≈øely to our former re≈øolutions in tho≈øe things: If wee remit and grow ≈ølack, and yield in anie of them, as it ≈øhall increa≈ø the hopes and endeavors of carnal and di≈ø-affected men, ≈øo ≈øhall it provoke</hi> GOD <hi>again≈øt us to leav us to our ≈øelvs, till we be plunged in a pit of back≈øliding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>It concern's us to take heed that wee do not tread the ≈øteps of tho≈øe, who carried on the late unlawful engagement again≈øt the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>in anie thing alreadie condemned by the Kirk and Kingdom, e≈øpecially to beware of changing the ≈øtate of our Cau≈ø, or altering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our quarrel, either by laying a≈øide of</hi> GOD's <hi>intere≈øt &amp; taking up of man's, or by preferring or equalling man's intere≈øt unto</hi> GODS; <hi>This were to turn up≈øide down the whole tenor of our Principles and Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and not onely to ≈øpoil us of all the comfort wee can look for from our Covenant, but al≈øo to bring upon our ≈øelvs the guilt and reproach of all the ≈øin of tho≈øe, who carried on that engagement, ≈øo much condemned and born te≈øtimonie again≈øt in this Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Wee would beware of lo≈øing the advantage of defenders, ≈øeeing our ≈øtrength mo≈øt con≈øi≈øt's in the equitie and clearne≈øs of the Cau≈ø, and the holie and righteous way in pur≈øuing of the ≈øame: It ≈øhall be better for us, rather to endure ≈øtraits for a time, then by precipitating and making ha≈øte in the dark, to ru≈øh again≈øt the wall and ≈øpoil our ≈øelvs of that peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which wee may have in waiting till</hi> GOD <hi>go before us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>Wee de≈øire that all the Land may bee ≈øtill pouring out their praiers and ≈øupplications before</hi> GOD, <hi>that the King's Maje≈øtie may really and wholly abandon all Malignant principles and coun≈øels, and join cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially in the Covenant and Cau≈ø of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p n="8">8 <hi>As all the people of</hi> GOD <hi>throughout the Land would bee careful
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114588:24"/>to di≈øcern of dangers and avoid ≈ønares from, and compliances with both Sectaries and Malignants, ≈øo would Mini≈øters bee diligent and faithful in pre≈øsing of the≈øe duties, and that in a ≈øolid and convincing way, and labor to make it appear that they ≈øpeak not again≈øt the one or the other from pa≈ø≈øion or intere≈øt, but upon the grounds of divine rea≈øon, and from the light &amp; autoritie of</hi> Gods <hi>Word; that ≈øo they may make them≈øelvs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt to the con≈øciences of their hearers, &amp; ≈øtop the mouth of gain-≈øayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, all the inhabitants of the Land ≈øhould beware of pride and carnal confidence, and in an humble way ≈øhould wait upon the</hi> LORD, <hi>and tread the ≈øteps of holine≈øs and righteou≈øne≈øs, and hee who hath don great things for us, ≈øhall yet ≈øave us.</hi> A. KER.</p>
            <p n="10">[10] You judg rightlie, that there bee <hi>≈øtore of Malignants,</hi> it may thank you and your <hi>Cabals,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The An≈øwer.</note> that wee have ≈øo manie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, your joyning with them and e≈øpou≈øing their Intere≈øt hath more ≈øtrengthened their hands, than anie proceedings of the Sectaries. Hath not your receiving the <hi>head of Malignants</hi> for your King, who hath been bred up in no other companie, nor followed other coun≈øels, and who≈øe heart is with them, though hee came to you to ≈øerv turns upon you; more hardened their hearts in their way, and animated them in their proceedings than anie thing that the Sectaries have ever don toward them. Wee com now to the particulars of your recommendation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And to this <hi>fir≈øt</hi> wee have nothing to ≈øay; but de≈øire that you, and wee al≈øo, may, without hypocri≈øie, do the thing you advi≈øe unto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the <hi>≈øecond;</hi> if you mean by <hi>contending earne≈øtly for the faith,</hi> not anie u≈øe of outward carnal ≈øtrife, but an earne≈øt ≈øtrife of the ≈øoul in it ≈øelf, in the ≈øpirit with God, for his gracious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øtation of the matter of our faith, wee agree for ≈øo much; onely wee mu≈øt expunge your there la≈øt words, conteining a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation to your Land; for you maie no more make your ≈øelvs a <hi>Catholick rule</hi> then <hi>Rome</hi> maie do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wee de≈øire you impartially to examine your hearts, and ≈øee if there bee not in you a great deal of enmitie again≈øt the work and people of God; which is ordinarily the work of an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri≈øtian pride; whereby you are apt to think, that you are, and that there are no other the people of God but your ≈øelvs; And this cau≈øeth your jealou≈øie of, and di≈øcontent and enmitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt anie other that laie claim to that priviledg, if they bee not al≈øo of the ≈øame complexion with you: with whom you will
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114588:24"/>not conver≈ø, lea≈øt you ≈øhould bee unprejudiced, and ≈øo run in danger of a <hi>Kirk-cen≈øure,</hi> by having a better opinion perhaps of a Sectarie, and thereby have your zeal brought to a Chri≈øtian temper, and directed to move rationally, according to its object. Wee mu≈øt tell you too, that there are ≈øom of your faction in this Land, Malignants <hi>jure divino,</hi> who by their in≈øinuations and ≈øecret infu≈øions, do foment faction, and ≈øow divi≈øion and di≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Government of this Common-wealth; and while they will pretend a con≈øcientiou≈øne≈øs, do more harm to the Peace of the Land, then the wor≈øt of the old Malignants. The≈øe wee ≈øhall mark, and cau≈ø them to avoid, or otherwi≈øe put them into a condition not much capable of doing us mi≈øchief.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It had been much more your wi≈ødom, and your happine≈øs, if you had taken diligent heed to have had nothing to do with your King, who is not like to bee much bound up by the de≈øires of your Kirk, though you recede nothing from them; or will your Religion bee verie ≈øecure by it? As for the peace of your Kingdom, lookers on think you have, by e≈øpou≈øing his quarrel, made it verie difficult to e≈øtabli≈øh and ≈øettle. Wee in <hi>England</hi> think you have, more waies then one, provoked God, and you are like enough to bee plunged into a deep pit of a la≈øting mi≈øerie.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Wee have onely here with ≈øad and tender hearts to lament the woful blindne≈øs and un≈øavourine≈øs that your <hi>formalitie</hi> and <hi>hypocri≈øie,</hi> by the ju≈øt judgment of God, hath brought upon you: That upon ≈øo ≈øerious an occa≈øion, as this is, you ≈øhould have no other rule to direct your actings and forbearings by, but the condemnations of your Kirk, and your Covenant: Wee blu≈øh and mourn while wee read the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages. Wee Sectaries are ≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at it; 'tis not your waie to make us your Pro≈øelytes; For wee believ and hold forth, that the ≈øacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the <hi>rule of all things to bee believed, and to bee don.</hi> Obtrude not your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor the Kirk upon us; wee ≈øhall condemn them both, if they either bee, or do anie thing that is contrarie to that ≈øacred rule. Are the≈øe expre≈ø≈øions becoming the≈øe times of light? wee thought them times of darkne≈øs, when the Scriptures were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; and the <hi>≈øentences,</hi> the <hi>decrees,</hi> the <hi>decretals</hi> and <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants,</hi> were made the rule of a Chri≈øtian faith and practice: How come's your Church to have gotten ≈øuch credit, that it ≈øhould bee emulous with <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>infallibilitie?</hi> Accu≈øtom your ≈øelvs therefore to Canonical language; and talk not of Gods inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114588:25"/>while you mea≈øure it not by God's Word; though by the waie wee mu≈øt tell you, that word <hi>Intere≈øt</hi> ≈øounded with God, is hardly concord in our ears.</p>
            <p n="6">6. You lo≈øt your advantage and defence, when you became <hi>Invaders;</hi> you ≈øhould have needed no <hi>defence</hi> again≈øt us, if you had not begun to <hi>invade,</hi> and proceed in ≈øuch waies as declare you ≈øtill <hi>enemies.</hi> If you had been righteous, it had been well for your ≈øelvs and us too; and when you are brought to a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bee ≈øo unrighteous no more, and that wee have ≈øuch an a≈ø≈øurance of it, as you cannot break, wee ≈øhall not de≈øire longer to pur≈øue you; and if this tenderne≈øs of not moving till God goe's before you, had po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed your Parlament in 1648, wee are confident you had never invaded <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. By this it ≈øeem's, you are not ≈øure of your King; your ≈øelvs doubt, whether hee bee real or not, and free from malignant principles? What meant you to bee troubled with him upon the≈øe uncertain terms? here was ≈øomthing at the bottom wil finde you out at la≈øt: You were in the beginning of you paper verie tender of joining with Malignants, or having anie in your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; why not ≈øo, as well as have an Armie for a Malignant? for it ≈øeem's your ≈øelvs dare not undertake hee is not one.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Wee wholy like your Coun≈øel to your Mini≈øters, and wi≈øh you would take the ≈øame Cour≈ø the next Papers you Emit; then perhaps wee might receiv ≈øom information or conviction; for wee profe≈øs our ≈øelvs readie to receiv it, when from tho≈øe grounds and principles; and wee would have you define or de≈øcribe a <hi>Seclarie,</hi> and tell us wherein is the poy≈øon of their opinions, and practice; for the name hath no harm in it. And wee begin to take it up and wear it verie contentedly: it ≈øeem's to us al≈øo that manie of tho≈øe men you ≈øo call are of the be≈øt among us, God hath honor'd them to do great ≈øervice to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that cau≈ø wee both love and honor them, and think wee have greater rea≈øon to do ≈øo, becau≈ø you hate them, for wee know you pur≈øue an intere≈øt quite contrarie to ours.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In this you are ≈øhort, you ≈øhould have added <hi>hypocri≈øie</hi> to your <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>carnal confidence.</hi> And truly if they would leav off their <hi>≈øwearing, uncleanne≈øs</hi> and <hi>drunkenne≈øs</hi> among you, which is ≈øo verie ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, it would do well. And if in a deep and true humilitie they would retire into them≈øelvs, and ≈øearch their hearts, and turn from all their evil waies and walk in the waies of righteou≈øne≈øs, and holine≈øs (a thing much ≈øpoken of, and arrogated by manie that neither have it, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand what 'tis) and meet the Lord in the <hi>waie of his judgments,</hi> and endeavor to agree with their adver≈øarie while hee is in the way, yee may vet bee ≈øafe, which would bee verie de≈øirable, ≈øo wee may bee ≈øatisfied and ≈øafe al≈øo.</p>
